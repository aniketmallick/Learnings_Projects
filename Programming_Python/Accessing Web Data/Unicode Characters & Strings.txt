# Finding ASCII of a character
ord('H') // O/P - 72

UTF-16 - Fixed Length - 2Bytes
UTF-32 - Fixed Length - 4Bytes
UTF-8 - 1-4 Bytes - Compatible with ASCII

In Python3 - 
x = b'abc'
type(x) // bytes

x = u'dffh'
type(x) // Unicode

# In python3 internally all strings are considered as UNICODE
# So working with string variables it works
# But working with data from the internet , sending or receiving packets of data we have encode & decode it (UTF-8)
