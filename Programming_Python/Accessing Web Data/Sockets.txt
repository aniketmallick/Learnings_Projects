# Python has built in support for TCP Sockets

import socket
mysock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) (This creates the object of the socket)
mysock.connect(('data.p4de.org',80)) # Host,port(This sets the Connection)

# HTTP protocol is the set of rules to allow browsers to retrieve web documents from servers over the internet

protocol   host     document

Whenever a link is clicked a GET request is done to the server and then the content is received and parsed out in the browser

# telnet - network protocol that allows users to remotely access a computer's command line interface
telnet www.abc.com 80
#once you are in you can pass in GET or other requests

# Sample HTTP Get and Receive
import socket
mysock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
mysock.connect(('data.p4de.org',80))
cmd = 'GET http://data.p4de.org/romeo.txt HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n'.encode()
mysock.send(cmd) # Send the command from the Connection

while True:
    data = mysock.recv(512); # Receive 512 bytes of data
    if(len(data)<1):
        break
    print(data.decode)  # This will first print Metadata and the content of the file
mysock.close()
