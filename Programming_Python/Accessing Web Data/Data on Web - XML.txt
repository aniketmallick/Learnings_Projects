Visualise XML as a tree

XML Schema - Contact between systems (will accept XML who will follow this Schema)
XSD Schema - Accepted by W3C

# XML import as tree
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

# ''' - Means it treats as multiline comment iwht every line we enter
data = '''<person>
        <name>Chuck</name>
    </person>'''

tree = ET.fromstring(data) # Converts the data into a tree(can break if data is not proper)
print('Name :',tree.find('name').text) # Taking out the content
print('Name :',tree.find('email').get('hide')) # Taking out the attribute
