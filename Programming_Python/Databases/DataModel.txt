# While Designing a Data Model, think of what is the most important thing that we should have
# Next start finding its relation 


# Primary Key - Unique keys ina table which are used to point to other table(Basically a FK for that table)
# Logical Key -  That unique key via which we identify from the outside world

# Joins - 
Select Album.title,Artist.name from Album join Artist on Album.artist_id = Artist.id

# Joining 2 tables without an on clause gives all possible combination of rows

# Multiple join can be done in clause
