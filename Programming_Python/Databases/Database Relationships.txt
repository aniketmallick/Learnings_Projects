# 1 - many 
Like mother -> children

# Many <-> Many 
In this there is no seperate primary key
So we need to model their relationship
So, we need to add a connection table with 2 foreign keys

            Author-Book junction table
Books -----<  Author -
                Books  >------- Author

Many to many tables always have a junction table where in the mappings and the extra attributes can be kept

Ex - 
User      User - Course                               Course
id           user_id                                  id
name         course_id                                course_name
             role
             Primary Key(user_id, course_id)

Role is an extra attribute and can be kept to designate roles with the combinations

User has 1 to many relation with User-Course and 
User-Course has many to 1 relation with Course
