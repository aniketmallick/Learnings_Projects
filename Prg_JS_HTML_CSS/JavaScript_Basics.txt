# Declaring and initializing variable - 
var x = 3;

var fgImage = new SimpleImage("drewRobert.png");
#fgImage will be pointing to the object which contains the image

# Method call
var w = fgImage.getWidth();

# Function - No object required to access
function square(x) {
    var ans = x * x;
    return ans;
}

var a = square(4);

How does Javascript knows the type?
1. Keeps track of it with the value
2. Called "dynamically typed"

# For types in Javascript
for(var obj of image.values()) {
    .....
}

In case of issues, Try to find bugs methodically
