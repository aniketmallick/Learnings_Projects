HTML & CSS - create & style pages
Js - Event driven Programming to create interactive pages

# Buttons with Divs - 

<input type = "button" value = "click here" onclick = "alert('clicked button')">
        |-> attribute   |-> Txt disp on bttn    |-> triggers event handler on click
This tag doesnot have any close tag

Also we can include the onclick code in a JS function - 
<input type = "button" value = "click here" onclick = "dochange()">

Js - 
func dochange() {
    alert('clicked button via JS impl');
}

## Ids are distinct and every element must have a distinct ID
   and in contrast many elements can have the same class

# Via JS we can perform with the web pages independently
  document - refers to the entire HTML document

# To access any element by id - 
  var div1 = document.getElementById("div1");  // Returns the elements object

# To change the class of a element - 
  div1.classname("desiredclass");

# To change the inner content of the id
  div1.innerHTML = "NewText"
